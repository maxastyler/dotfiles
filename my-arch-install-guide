Install nm, nmtui when pacstrapping

Nice system partitions:
/	- ext4
/boot	- ext4/efi (fat32)
/var	- ext4
/tmp	- ext4
/home	- ext4
swap 	- (use swapon before genfstabbing)

When adding users, only need to add to group Wheel. Other stuff can be added later.

Comment out line in /etc/sudoers:
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL

To get keyboard conf working, use 
localectl --no-convert set-x11-keymap gb
Console keymap us uk

########Steps to install on my little laptop

[arch]https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide

1. Run command $loadkeys uk
2. Use wifi-menu to connect to internet
3. $timedatectl set-ntp true #Correct time-zone will be selected later
4. fdisk -l #List the disks, probably gonna be dev/sda(x) Nice setup might be... 
	/dev/sda1 - /boot 	ext4 500Mb
	/dev/sda2 - / 		ext4 30Gb
	/dev/sda3 - swap 	swap 2Gb
	/dev/sda4 - /home 	ext4 200Gb
5. Once disks are set up, make filesystems on them - ext4 for all but the swap partition which is "linux swap/ solaris"
6. Run $swapon /dev/sda{swap} # to set the swap up before running genfstab, or swap won't be added
7. Mount the filesystems to their points int /mnt/
8. Pacman mirrors should be fine
9. Use $pacstrap /mnt base base-devel networkmanager #Installs the base packages to the system, along with some development stuff. networkmanager is used to get the wifi back once chrooted
10. Generate the fstab! $genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab #Shows where partitions should be mounted
11. $arch-chroot /mnt #Change root into the newly installed system
12. Link the timezone to /etc/localtime: $ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/London /etc/localtime
13. Run hwclock: $hwclock --systohc
14. Uncomment en_GB.UTF-8 in /etc/locale.gen then $locale-gen
15. In /etc/locale.conf write: "LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
16. In /etc/vconsole.conf write : "KEYMAP=uk" 
17. Put your wanted hostname in /etc/hostname, eg: my-first-computer
18. Add a line to /etc/hosts: "127.0.1.1	my-first-computer.localdomain	my-first-computer"
19. Network should still be set. Network manager should do :)
20. Set root password eg: $passwd [ENTER] hobnobgobbler
21. If using uefi, use systemd-boot otherwise use grub.
22. Install grub: pacman -S grub
23. Install grub to disk: $grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda #Just just the whole disk, not the individual partitions
24. $grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
25. With intel cpu, install intel-ucode package
26. Run command in step 24 again, might not need to run this twice if intel-ucode installed before running grub make command. Nice to be safe though :^)
27. $exit
28. $umount -R /mnt
29. $shutdown now #Take out usb and then turn on again. Should boot into a terminal

#####Installed now!

1. Disable wpa_supplicant before enabling NetworkManager, $systemctl disable wpa_supplicant
2. Once logged in, connect to the internet. If using networkmanager, enable the service with $systemctl enable NetworkManager (This will then keep running every time. Start the service with $systemctl start NetworkManager (NetworkManager is case sensitive. trying enable networkmanager won't work)
3. Once networkmanager is started, run nmtui and connect to a network.2. Once networkmanager is started, run nmtui and connect to a network.
4. Install zsh. Nicer shell than bash. This is what users can use. $pacman -S zsh
5. Add a user, add to group wheel and set default shell to zsh. $useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/zsh monkey
6. Change that user's password. $passwd monkey
7. Let any user in wheel use the sudo command: Edit /etc/sudoers and uncomment the line: # %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
8. Exit, $exit and log back in as the new user. You'll have to run the zsh config. Don't bother if you already have a .zshrc lined up.
9. Install git so you can get yaourt, super-pacman. $sudo pacman -S git
10. Make a git directory in your home folder: $mkdir ~/git; $cd ~/git
11. Follow these instructions:
	$git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/package-query.git
	$cd package-query
	$makepkg -si
	$cd ..
	$git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yaourt.git
	$cd yaourt
	$makepkg -si
	$cd ..
You now have yaourt installed. This has pretty much all the same commands as pacman eg, yaourt -Ss to search. yaourt -S to install
12. Install nice stuff: 
yaourt -S:

xorg (Graphics. This is a group of packages, maybe not all needed but I haven't looked at what's the minimum necessary yet)
vim (Sweet text editor)
lightdm  (login manager)
lightdm-gtk-greeter (Needed to actually see anything on login)
lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings (If you want to change how the login page looks)
bspwm (window manager)
sxhkd (bspwm's keyboard manager)
palemoon-bin (nice browser based off firefox, lighter. If you want to compile each time, just use palemoon without the bin)
rxvt-unicode-patched (urxvt terminal with support for some more fonts)
dmenu
lemonbar-xft-git (Status bar with support for xft fonts)
ranger (console based file manager)
pcmanfm (X based file manager)
scrot (screenshot taker)
feh (Simple image viewer, and background setter)
ncmpcpp (Console based music player, support for mpd)
mopidy
python-pip
python2-pip
vim-pathogen
light (For controlling the backlight)
pulseaudio (If you want pulse. I prefer it to ALSA)
pamixer (A terminal control for pulse volume)
stow (For managing dotfiles)
oh-my-zsh-git (A nice zsh setup, stuff like vim keys n nice themes)
w3m (For viewing images in the terminal. Crazy!)
fontconfig-infinality (Nicer looking font rendering)
terminus-font-ttf
terminus-font
otf-font-awesome
ttf-font-awesome
terminess-powerline-font-git
xdo-git
mpc
xtitle
tcl
tk
insync
vim-airline
stalonetray
powerline
nm-connection-editor (nmtui can't edit the connections too well, this is for ones with spookier configs (eg. eduroam))
apvlv

13. Enable the lightdm service to start on startup: $sudo systemctl enable lightdm
14. Reboot, hopefully it'll work. $reboot
15. Once logged in, a black screen should appear with a cursor. This is bspwm. 
If you want just a minimal install, go to a terminal ([ctrl]+[alt]+F{2, 3, 4, 5, ...}) and copy the example files from /usr/share/doc/bspwm/examples into their folders in ~/.config 
eg:
$mkdir -p ~/.config/bspwm
$cp /usr/share/doc/bspwm/examples/bspwmrc ~/.config/bspwm
$mkdir -p ~/.config/sxhkd
$cp /usr/share/doc/bspwm/examples/sxhkdrc ~/.config/sxhkd
Now, kill bspwm, and login again on lightdm: $pkill bspwm
Once logged in, you should be able to open terminals with [mod+enter]

16. Set the X keymap with localectl:

$localectl --no-convert set-x11-keymap gb

17. download the dotfiles in home folder:
$cd ~
$git clone https://github.com/mtyler88/dotfiles.git 
$cd dotfiles

Once they are installed, the stow command can be used to install the config files into home, eg: $stow bspwm
You might need to delete the ~/.config/bspwmrc and ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc files if you'd copied them before:
$rm ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc

18. Stow all you want. Most things should be installed, but some might need more fonts n that

Enable tapping with the toucpad and that:
If using the synaptics touchpad driver, make a file:
sudo vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf

Put in it:

Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "touchpad"
	Driver "synaptics"
	MatchIsTouchpad "on"
		Option "TapButton1" "1"
		Option "TapButton2" "3"
		Option "TapButton3" "2"
EndSection

For installing gmusic, gmusic access in the terminal, you need mopidy-gmusic from pip:
$sudo pip2 install Mopidy-GMusic
$sudo pip install Mopidy-GMusic
make mopidy use python2.7, edit /usr/bin/mopidy and change #!/usr/bin/python to #!/usr/bin/python2
$sudo systemctl start mopidy
If you want mopidy auto-started:
$sudo systemctl enable mopidy
Generate an app password for mopidy-gmusic using google online. Then add into the mopidy config file, /etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf
[gmusic]
username=
password=
deviceid=
bitrate=320

Setting up Palemoon:
Install the pentadactyl extension
Navigation bar -> get more search engines -> get google
Install adblock latitude

Installing lemonbar:
Add ~/.config/lemonbar/ to the PATH variable. Do this by adding the line: export PATH=$PATH:/home/(your username)/.config/lemonbar to the file /etc/profile
In lemonbar config file, set the wireless device to whatever your device is called
